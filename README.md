# AREA OF CIRCLE AND VOLUME OF CYLINDER
This C program calculates the area of a circle and the volume of a cylinder based on user-provided dimensions. The user is prompted to enter the radius of the circle and the radius and height of the cylinder, and the program computes the respective values.

Features
Calculates the area of a circle using the formula: [ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 ]
Calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula: [ \text{Volume} = \pi \times r^2 \times h ]
Displays the results with two decimal precision.
